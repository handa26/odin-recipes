      Still finding zucchini at the back of the refrigerator? Use it in a
      different way with this fun presentation that takes the summer veg and

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (8 ounce) zucchini</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 pound mild Italian pork sausage</li>
      <li>1/2 cup minced yellow onion</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups marinara sauce</li>
      <li>6 ounces shredded low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon finely chopped mixed fresh tender herbs, such as flat-leaf
        parsley and basil
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 13-x9-inch
        baking dish with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut zucchini in half lengthwise; cut off and discard stem ends. Using a
        spoon, scoop and scrape out pulp from center of each zucchini half,
        creating a 1/2-inch-thick shell. Measure out 3/4 cup zucchini pulp, and
        discard or reserve remaining pulp for another use. Arrange zucchini
        halves, cut side up, in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with
        Italian seasoning, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add Italian sausage; cook,
        stirring and breaking up with a spatula, until browned and crumbly,
        about 5 minutes. Stir in onion, garlic, crushed red pepper, the 3/4 cup
        zucchini pulp, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring
        occasionally, until vegetables are softened and liquid is absorbed,
        about 5 minutes. Stir in marinara, and bring to a simmer over
        medium-high heat. Simmer, undisturbed, until slightly thickened, 3 to 5
        minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon about 1/2 cup pork mixture into each zucchini half; sprinkle
        evenly with mozzarella and Parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini is tender and cheese is melted
        and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle evenly with herbs; serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
