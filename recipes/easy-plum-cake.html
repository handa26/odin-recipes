    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      We're still seeing plums at the market, so editor Courtney Kassel's
      grandpa's torte is on the menu. This recipe is superb with the Italian
      plums she waits all year for but works with whatever you can get your
      hands on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our easy version is made with a buttery sponge cake topped with sliced
      plums, cinnamon, and sugar, then baked to perfection. Courtney adds, "It's
      a recipe that tastes like love."

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>12 medium ripe plums, halved and pitted</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons cinnamon sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch
        springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer
        until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each
        addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl and
        sift on top of the butter mixture; mix to combine. Transfer batter into
        the prepared springform pan and smooth out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set plums inside batter, cut-side up, and sprinkle evenly with
        cinnamon-sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven on the lowest rack until a toothpick inserted
        into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm or cool to
        room temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
